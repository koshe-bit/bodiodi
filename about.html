      <h1>About</h1>

      <p class="about-name">
        <strong>Nicole Kosheba</strong>, Group Trainer / Owner
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve been leading group fitness classes since 2011, working with people across Grand Rapids in studios,
        workplaces, and community spaces. For the past decade, I taught at CKO Kickboxing, and I’ve also led
        after-work programs for local businesses like Custer Furniture and Rockford Construction. Over the years,
        I’ve coached hundreds of bodies, personalities, energy levels, and life stages—and that experience has
        shaped how I train people today.
      </p>

      <p>
        The gym has always been my happy place. It’s where I go to reset, release stress, and reconnect with myself.
        But what I’ve learned is this: movement is better when it’s shared. I created Bodiodi to be a space where you
        can show up exactly as you are and take what you need that day. Maybe you’re tired and want to zone out.
        Maybe you’re energized and ready to push. Either way, you don’t have to perform or prove anything here.
        My job is to guide you through training that’s functional, healthy, and genuinely fun—so you leave feeling
        stronger, clearer, and more like yourself.
